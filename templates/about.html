        <div>
            <p>Hello! I’m Joe, and I’m a healthcare auditor and self-taught data analyst who’s spent<br>
                months building portfolio projects and strengthening my skills in <strong>Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau</strong>.</p>

            <p>With a background in engineering, project coordination, quality review, and political research,<br>
                I’ve developed a burning passion for digging into data, uncovering insights, and turning<br>
                complex information into something clear, useful, and actionable.</p>

            <p>I’m ready to bring that enthusiasm for data, experience with hands-on projects, and hunger to learn more<br>
                into my next role as a <strong>data analyst and/or developer</strong>, and I’m excited to make a positive impact!</p>

    <h2>A History</h2>

    <div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 20px;">
        <div class="image-hover-container" style="max-width: 200px; border-radius: 10px; box-shadow: 0 0 10px #000;">

        <div>
            <p>After earning my <strong>Bachelor’s in Civil Engineering</strong> from SIUE in 2019, I started out in<br>
                <strong>engineering and project coordination</strong> roles where I developed a sharp eye for <strong>process, research, and data</strong>.<br>
                I was later impacted by COVID-related cuts, and family needs brought me back to Illinois.</p>

            <p>In the years since, I’ve pivoted into roles that refined my <strong>analytical, organizational, and support skills</strong>,<br>
                from customer support analytics at Amplify to my current position as a Patient Case Auditor at ApexNetwork Physical Therapy,<br>
                where I manage large volumes of data with over <strong>99% accuracy</strong>.</p>

            <p>In 2024, I interned with Relentless during the election cycle, working directly with voter files and polling data<br>
                to support digital organizing efforts. That experience reignited my passion for meaningful data work and inspired me<br>
                to double down on growing my technical skills. Over the past several months, I’ve built up a strong foundation<br>
                in <strong>Python, SQL, Excel, and Tableau</strong> through portfolio projects, independent study, and lots<br>
                of messy Jupyter Notebooks. Now, I’m looking ahead to my next chapter: stepping fully into a data analyst or developer role<br>
                where I can apply my skills, solve real-world problems, and keep growing in an environment that values curiosity, insight, and determination.</p>
