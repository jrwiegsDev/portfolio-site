# Joe's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the source code for [jrwportfolio.com](https://www.jrwportfolio.com) — a fully custom portfolio site built using Python and Flask.

This site was written and coded entirely by me after just one month of hands-on Python practice. It showcases not only my technical projects but also my growth as a self-taught data analyst and developer.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3
- Flask – for routing and rendering
- HTML5 + CSS3 – fully hand-coded layout and styling
- Jinja2 – for templating and reusable components
- Render – for live deployment
- Namecheap – for custom domain connection

## Site Structure

The site is organized into four key pages:

1. Home – Quick snapshot of who I am and what I do  
2. About – More detailed bio, personal background, and goals  
3. Projects – Interactive portfolio sorted by:
   - Python
   - SQL
   - Excel
   - Tableau  
4. Contact – How to reach me or connect professionally

Each project section links to dedicated folders or live visualizations when available.

## Development Highlights

- Designed and styled from scratch with minimalist, mobile-friendly layout  
- Integrated custom images, hover effects, and a grayscale color scheme  with a yellow-blue nod to the Python logo 
- Built routing logic manually using Flask’s core features  
- Connected GitHub repos and Tableau visualizations for a seamless portfolio

## Ongoing Updates

This site will grow as I grow. I plan to:

- Add more Python projects; thing's I'm interested in, things I can automate, things I can build
- Improve interactivity and visuals  
- Possibly add downloadable resume and blog features

## Final Note

This site is a personal milestone. It represents not just technical progress but real dedication.
